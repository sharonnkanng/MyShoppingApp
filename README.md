3. The shopping list has a “New Item” menu in the TopAppBar that opens a New Item Dialog, where the user can pick up new items that appear on the Shopping List.
4. Proper error messages are shown in case of empty fields, etc.
5. The shopping list supports removing items in two ways: one by one and all items at the same time (“Delete all” button).
